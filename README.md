# R-meeting
Repo to discuss R code at Rutgers University

Weekly meetings dedicated to R; in which we share (and learn) interesting aspects of the programming language that can help us advance ou(R)search at the University. 

Two speakers per week (30 minutes per presentation) will be encouraged to share R code with the audience: it could be functions you wrote, packages you are using, new visualization methods or graphing libraries, how-to tutorials on conducting statistical analysis, etc. 

INCLUSIVITY & DIVERSITY are paramount! Students (undergrads and grads), Postdocs, Faculty and Staff are welcome. Women and persons from different races, ethnicities, sexual and religious orientations are encouraged to participate. All levels of programming experience are welcome. The objective is to build a safe space where to explore ou(R) curiosity for the language.
